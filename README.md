Adds explaining tooltips querying their content from a MediaWiki installation, e.g. Wikipedia.org.

# Description

Adds explaining tooltips querying their content from a [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org "see MediaWiki docs") installation, e.g. [Wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org "see the well-known Wikipedia"). Therefore shortcodes can be used in Posts and Pages to mark keywords and link them to public Wiki pages. The well-known package of [Tooltipster](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/ "Tooltipster rocks :)") is used to create the nice and themable tooltips.

Main features of the current version are:

* Setup the wanted Wiki base and several other options at a backend page
* Integrate the Wiki tooltip using shortcodes in Posts and Pages

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I use any Wiki installation as base for my tooltips?

Sure, as long as the used installation provides an API structured like the [API of MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page "see API of MediaWiki") it will work perfectly. You can use one of the public Wikipedias or setup your own Wiki URL.

## Am I able to style the links to Wiki pages in another way than all other links in the blog?

Yes, you can define extra CSS style properties that are used at all links to Wiki pages!
